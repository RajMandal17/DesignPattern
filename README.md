# Singleton Design Pattern - Comprehensive Java Implementation

This project demonstrates all types of Singleton design patterns with practical examples, performance comparisons, and real-world scenarios.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- **5 Different Singleton Implementations** with their pros and cons
- **When to use each pattern** and when to avoid them
- **Thread safety considerations** and performance implications
- **Practical scenarios** with real business logic examples
- **Best practices** for production applications

## 🎯 Singleton Patterns Implemented

### 1. Eager Initialization Singleton (`DatabaseConnection`)
- **Instance created at class loading time**
- ✅ Thread-safe without synchronization
- ❌ Instance created even if never used
- 🎯 **Use for**: Always-needed instances (database connections)

### 2. Lazy Initialization Singleton (`Logger`)
- **Instance created only when first accessed**
- ✅ Memory efficient if instance not used
- ❌ **NOT thread-safe** (demonstration purposes only)
- 🎯 **Use for**: Single-threaded applications only

### 3. Thread-Safe Singleton (`ConfigurationManager`)
- **Uses synchronized methods for thread safety**
- ✅ Thread-safe with lazy initialization
- ❌ Performance overhead on every call
- 🎯 **Use for**: Multi-threaded apps where performance isn't critical

### 4. Bill Pugh Singleton (`CacheManager`) - **RECOMMENDED**
- **Uses inner static class for lazy loading**
- ✅ Best performance + thread safety + lazy loading
- ✅ No synchronization overhead
- 🎯 **Use for**: Most production applications

### 5. Enum Singleton (`ApplicationState`) - **SAFEST**
- **Uses enum for ultimate safety**
- ✅ Reflection-proof and serialization-safe
- ✅ Concise implementation
- ❌ Cannot extend classes, eager initialization
- 🎯 **Use for**: Application state, maximum security needs

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE or command line

### Compilation
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /workspaces/DesignPattern

# Compile all Java files
javac -d . src/com/designpattern/**/*.java src/com/designpattern/*.java
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Run the main demo application
java com.designpattern.SingletonPatternDemo
```

## 🎮 Interactive Menu

The application provides an interactive menu with:

1. **Individual Pattern Demonstrations** - See each pattern in action
2. **Complete Demo** - Run all patterns sequentially
3. **Performance Comparisons** - See speed differences
4. **Thread Safety Tests** - Understand concurrency issues
5. **Pattern Comparison Summary** - Quick reference guide

## 💡 Key Learning Points

### When to Use Each Pattern

| Pattern | Thread Safety | Performance | Lazy Loading | Use Case |
|---------|---------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Eager | ✅ | High | ❌ | Always-needed instances |
| Lazy | ❌ | High | ✅ | Single-threaded only |
| Thread-Safe | ✅ | Medium | ✅ | Multi-threaded, medium load |
| Bill Pugh | ✅ | High | ✅ | **Most production apps** |
| Enum | ✅ | High | ❌ | Maximum security needs |

### Best Practices

1. **Default Choice**: Use Bill Pugh Singleton for most scenarios
2. **Maximum Security**: Use Enum Singleton when protection against reflection/serialization is crucial
3. **Always-Used Instances**: Use Eager Initialization for database connections, etc.
4. **Avoid**: Never use Lazy (non-thread-safe) in production multi-threaded applications
